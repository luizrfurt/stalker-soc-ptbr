4|<text>Bandits! Those sons of bitches were taking me to the old factory. I don't know what they were planning to do with me there. I saw them take another guy in there before and I never saw him after that. They've got another one of ours, Serega. They keep him in the basement... in that big unfinished building there. Help him, would ya? Otherwise they'll... you know...</text>
7|<text>Do you know what they've got there at the factory?</text>
10|<text>I haven't heard much. All I know is that their boss Borov has part of the key to the underground there. There used to be a lab or something... I did hear that Borov has been eager to get inside, but can't without the second half of the key. Umm... if you're thinking of trying to get inside, think twice before you do. It's full of thugs.</text>
13|<text>Gotcha. Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.</text>
16|<text>I'll try to help your man.</text>
19|<text>It's a shame about my partner... He was a great guy. But still, I owe you.</text>
22|<text>These things happen.</text>
25|<text>Thanks for your help!</text>
28|<text>Bye.</text>
31|<text>You don't give a damn about people. What's there to discuss between you and me?</text>
34|<text>Thanks! You got my partner out of there! Here, take this - it's from the bottom of my heart.</text>
37|<text>Deal.</text>
40|<text>I guess you must know this area well. What's interesting here?</text>
43|<text>To the North there's a bandit camp. To the East - an old factory. To the Southwest - a deserted pig farm, and some kind of gate beyond it... I can't say what's there, never been that far.</text>
46|<text>Would you tell me more about the bandit camp?</text>
49|<text>Hmm, what about it... They settled in an unfinished building straight North of here. Their leader is Borov - a real animal, that bastard. That's why they sent us here, to finish him off.</text>
52|<text>What's happening on the factory?</text>
55|<text>We managed to find out that there is some kind of vault there. Only it's guarded like Fort Knox.</text>
58|<text>What kind of vault? What's inside it?</text>
61|<text>I don't know but we dare to step inside. The only thing I do know is that Borov has one half of the key to its entrance.</text>
64|<text>A real pig farm? With actual pigs?</text>
67|<text>Drooling for some pork chops already, huh? Heck, the Zone is full of boars! Take a bite of one of those and you won't be needing a flashlight anymore - that's how bad you'll be glowing in the dark! OK, OK, just kidding... The farm has long been abandoned and is now home to some stalkers. They didn't make a good impression on me, though, and I usually trust my gut feeling.</text>
70|<text>What's this gate you were talking about?</text>
73|<text>I can't figure it out. Just an old gate, except it's locked and well guarded. We haven't set foot in there.</text>
76|<text>I see, thanks.</text>
79|<text>You're welcome! Come back any time.</text>
82|<text>Just the two of you went on a scouting raid?</text>
85|<text>There was another guy, Serega. I don't know, he's gone and I haven't heard from him... The gang must have dealt with him after all.</text>
88|<text>Take care.</text>
91|<text>So, friend... What's going to happen with me now?.. Thanks. At least you tried to help. And I do keep my word.</text>
94|<text>Thanks for your help! What else did you want to know about?</text>
97|<text>You refused to help when I asked you. We have nothing to discuss. Get lost.</text>
100|<text>Bye.</text>
103|<text>Hey, buddy! Help me! I'm a Duty scout. Help me get out!</text>
106|<text>I'll try.</text>
109|<text>There's nothing I can do for you.</text>
112|<text>Thanks, brother! I owe you one. Look what I was able to find out - it might prove useful to you, who knows... Borov - the one who calls the shots - has collected quite a lot of goodies. He's got a piece of the key to the lower level at the old factory. I heard the guards yacking, they said there used to be some kind of lab there. Thing is, getting close to Borov isn't so simple.</text>
115|<text>Thanks for the information.</text>
118|<text>It's time to get back to our guys. Something tells me we'll be lucky to get out of here alive...</text>
121|<text>Good luck.</text>
124|<text>We gotta get outta here before these bastards decide to check this place out! Need something? Get it quick!</text>
127|<text>Nope, nothing.</text>
130|<text>Hey! There's a switch over there on the wall - it opens the cell door.</text>
133|<text>OK, I'll look.</text>
136|<text>Hey, want an awesome gun? I found a little something near Yantar... a stash, I guess. There was this Gauss rifle among other things. I tell you, this thing rocks - anyone within a hundred meters of it is as good as dead... You can have it for just 800.</text>
139|<text>Here's the money.</text>
142|<text>Thanks, but no thanks.</text>
145|<text>Nah, keep it. Money is hard to come by.</text>
148|<text>Got the money? Hurry up. I've had a lot of customers... They'll be coming back soon.</text>
151|<text>Excellent. Wait here, I'll go get it.</text>
154|<text>Waiting.</text>
157|<text>Hey, gimme a medkit!</text>
160|<text>Here you are.</text>
163|<text>Sorry, I don't have a medkit.</text>
166|<text>Thanks, you bailed me out for real. If I live long enough to see you again, I'll try to pay you back. Right now all I can spare is a juicy tip. OK, to the South of here, there's a farm where some easygoing stalkers set up camp. One of them is selling a Gauss rifle real cheap, just 800. I was going to buy it, and then got knee deep in shit... So, if you've got the dough, go right ahead.</text>
169|<text>Thanks for the information.</text>
172|<text>I owe you, and I always repay my debts. Let's go.</text>
175|<text>Excellent. Now we'll tear everyone up.</text>
178|<text>Sorry, I have other plans.</text>
181|<text>Well, good luck then.</text>
184|<text>Bye.</text>
