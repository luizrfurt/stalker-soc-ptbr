4|<text>For now our secret stash is in the tunnel. That's a good place - few know about it, and the anomalies will keep others from getting in.</text>
7|<text>Seriy's secret stash</text>
10|<text>I hid it in the stump by the tunnel. There's a good hole there.</text>
13|<text>Stump with hole</text>
16|<text>I buried some goodies under the cross by the bush.</text>
19|<text>The mark is under the cross</text>
22|<text>Dropped the backpack under the fallen tree.</text>

31|<text>Backpack of a chimney sweeper</text>
34|<text>Stashed the chest on the roof of the factory - that way nobody will find it. Problem is, it will rust under the rain.</text>
37|<text>Chest on the roof</text>
40|<text>They were shooting. Had to drop the backpack under the train car behind the seat. At least I got away. I'll go back and get it.</text>
43|<text>Drunkard's backpack</text>
46|<text>Hid it under the cross, behind the cisterns. Dig a little, just don't get carried away.</text>
49|<text>By the three cisterns</text>
52|<text>I put the backpack towards the top at the factory, that way nobody will see it. Problem is, I don't exactly remember what's in it.</text>
55|<text>Backpack is in the porthole</text>
58|<text>I hid my things in a chest inside the factory</text>
61|<text>Radioactive chest</text>

76|<text>Dropped the bag out the window. Will pick it up later.</text>
79|<text>The bag is on the support beam</text>
82|<text>Kolyan and I had a nice walk at the Agroprom. We found a bunch of junk, but managed to hide a few things. We put the chest in the trash bin.</text>
85|<text>Trash bin</text>
88|<text>I found a safe under a fallen tree. Going to hide everything there for now.</text>
91|<text>Safe under the tree</text>
94|<text>I threw the things into the pipe, will get them later. I had to, otherwise I would have obviously taken them along. Just hope they don't get wet.</text>
97|<text>Things in the pipe</text>
100|<text>The goods are in the old pipe, we'll have to tell the guys that. I'm not climbing in there.</text>
103|<text>Radioactive pipe</text>
106|<text>Ran away from the base, to hell with them! Dodged the stalkers' fire. Hid my stuff in a pile in a pipe.  I'll hang out here until they leave, then I'll pick it up.</text>
109|<text>The pile</text>
112|<text>There is a half buried safe under the bush - that's where I hide everything.</text>
115|<text>Safe under the bush</text>
118|<text>They discovered the chest under the support beam. Someone was dragging it along all the way from Scientific Research Institute. Let's wait for the windflier and then pick it up.</text>

124|<text>Hid my stuff in an iron capsule</text>
127|<text>Under the trap door</text>

178|<text>Hid the backpack behind slabs of concrete, packing light. I'll be hungry but at least alive.</text>
181|<text>Backpack is in a side-street</text>
184|<text>Chest is behind a rusted "barrel" in the underground, everything is in it. There's no way I'm going back there. It's a miracle that I busted the bloodsucker. Still don't remember how.</text>
187|<text>Bloodsucker's chest</text>
190|<text>There are some goodies behind the door. I'm answering for the goods in store!</text>
193|<text>Stalker's goodies</text>

262|<text>Hid it in the pipe under the stairs</text>
265|<text>Secret stash</text>
268|<text>Hid the goods not far from the bar, behind the anomalies - nobody will get in there. And even if they got there they wouldn't know how to open it. But it's all very simple - just pull up slightly at the door, and everything will open.</text>

370|<text>Hid the goods right under the roof of the little house by the bridge.</text>
373|<text>Goods of the shooter</text>
376|<text>Hid my crap in one of the chests not far from the bridge. That's it, I'm calling it quits and leaving the Zone. Farewell, brothers! I'll never forget the motherland.</text>
379|<text>Things by the bridge</text>
382|<text>One of the stalkers choked by the newbies' camp. Check out his goods.</text>
385|<text>The backpack is near the village</text>
388|<text>Found out from Lihoi that the secret stash is in the cellar. He was talking too much so we shut him up for good.</text>
391|<text>Cellar in the village</text>
394|<text>Found a great hiding place in the cellar. I'll wait until someone puts something there.</text>
397|<text>A good place</text>
400|<text>Found out from Vorpal that there's a secret stash in the cellar. Our men were carrying out a scouting expedition in the area. Let's check it out.</text>
403|<text>Vorpal's secret stash</text>
406|<text>They saw that the commander has a tricky chest in his office, and there's a ton of valuable goods there.</text>
409|<text>The valuables of the commander</text>
412|<text>Some stalker croaked not far from the camp of the newbies. We should see what he was carrying. Who lets them in here anyway?</text>
415|<text>By a country road</text>
418|<text>The goodies are hidden in the bandits' cellar. They weren't there before so let's wait for the right time to take them all. </text>
421|<text>The robbers' cellar</text>
424|<text>Discovered the inventory in the pipe, not far from the farm. Once the stockade is over, I'll definitely come back.</text>
427|<text>Gas pipe</text>
430|<text>Threw my backpack off not far from the post, should pick it up as soon as possible, before the commander transfers us to a new location.</text>
433|<text>Hidden things</text>
436|<text>I left the chest at the tower for now. Will pick it up when I can.</text>
439|<text>Tower at the check-point</text>
442|<text>I saw how a bandit hid his goods in a chest in the hangar. How can I quietly steal it?</text>
445|<text>Bandits' storage</text>
448|<text>Vasya and I went to check things out and suddenly a bullet hit him. And I had nothing to do with it. It's the damn bullet. I hid the stuff away in a pipe.</text>
451|<text>Old crane</text>
454|<text>Grizzly croaked with all of his stuff at the Garbage, in the train tunnel behind the diesel. Pity about Grizzly.</text>

463|<text>Pipe on the North pile</text>

505|<text>Log in the forest</text>
508|<text>Petrenko wanted to pass on the word that there's information about the secret stash of the Strelok faction at the Garbage.

541|<text>Storage in the scrap metal yard.</text>

547|<text>Supplies in the chest</text>
550|<text>I stuck the habar into the pipe at the garbage. It won't stay there for long.</text>

1261|<text>Secret stash of a grouping</text>
1264|<text>Another volunteer stalker croaked because another prototype didn't protect him from the radiation. He only made it to the middle of the territory, and stayed there.
