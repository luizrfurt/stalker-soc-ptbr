259|<text>The modified closing system increases the speed of shooting.</text>
262|<text>The weight and size of the Akm 74/2U are similar to those of a submachine gun, but its operation mode and the ammunition it uses place it into the class of the assault rifles.

The accuracy and the killing power of this gun exceed those of all other small arms.\n Ammunition: 2-mm Gauss rounds.</text>
301|<text>An assault rifle combined with a grenade launcher. It is a very good type of assault rifle for the Zone conditions: it is compact, reliable, but universal and powerful.

310|<text>Hunting knife</text>

325|<text>Modification of storming weaponry for firing single shots. It was assumed that it was going to be used as a cheap analog to the sniper rifle.</text>
328|<text>One of the best weapons in the submachine gun class. During the last decades of the 20th century it was adopted by the army and police special forces units in many countries. When it was gradually replaced with more up-to-date models, it appeared on the black market, and then in the Zone.\n Ammunition:\n standard 9x19 mm FMJ,\n improved 9x19 mm PB1s.</text>
331|<text>Light, compact, and now redone to fit a more wide-spread caliber, this machine gun is a true find for beginning shooters.</text>

343|<text>A revolver-type grenade launcher. Sometimes, it is just indispensable, particularly when targeting large numbers of mutants, attacking well-guarded stationary objects or fighting especially tough creatures.\n Ammunition: VOG-25 grenade,\n and VOG-25R grenade.</text>
346|<text>A variation of the revolving granade launcher. The given model is made especially for use of granades of the western model.</text>

Such weapon is rare for stalkers: its huge dimensions and heavy weight make it unpopular, though it is indispensable for some missions.\n Ammunition: OG-7V.</text>
352|<text>The weapon was made for warfare in the city. To lessen the weight, some parts were removed or replaced. As a result, there is no way to attach neither a sight nor a granade launcher under the barrell. But at least it weighs almost half of what it did before.</text>
355|<text>Modified for sniper fire. Furnished with a non-removeable optical sight of heightened focus.</text>
358|<text>A model developed back in 1975 but still popular all around the world. Its magazine has low capacity, but its mechanism is absolutely reliable. Its second advantage is the use of the high-powered Kora round.\n Ammunition:\n standard .45 ACP,\n improved .45 ACP Hydro-Shock.</text>
361|<text>A relatively new assault rifle for the 5.56x45 mm SS109 round. This weapon is very popular due to its accuracy, soft recoil, and high reliability.\n Ammunition:\n standard 5.56x45 mm SS109,\n armor-piercing 5.56x45 mm AP.</text>
364|<text>The SPSA14 smooth-bore rifle was developed in the late 1970th. This weapon is very reliable and flexibly used. It is however relatively big, expensive and its mechanism is too complex.

379|<text>This hunting rifle is popular but there’s nothing noteworthy about it.\n Ammunition:\n 12x70 shot,\n 12x76 slug,\n 12x76 dart.</text>
382|<text>A reliable weapon. As a quality compact close-range weapon, it is very popular among the Zone veterans.\n Ammunition:\n standard .45 ACP,\n improved .45 ACP Hydro-Shock.</text>

388|<text>Differs from the basic model in its ability to add an optical sight PSO-1.</text>
391|<text>A special sniper rifle designed for noiseless and flameless sniper fire and equipped with an integrated silencer. It can pierce any bulletproof vest at a range of 400 meters. It is a weapon highly valued by stalkers of any level.\n Ammunition:\n standard 9x39 mm PAB-9,\n armor-piercing 9x39 mm SP-6,\n sniper 9x39 mm SP-5.</text>
394|<text>An excellent pistol. Highly reliable with a high capacity magazine and a good fire accuracy, especially in the case of the model designed for the 9 mm FMJ round.\n Ammunition:\n standard 9x19 mm FMJ,\n improved 9x19 mm PB1s.</text>
397|<text>Modification of the gun for ability to use bullets of the 9x18mm calibre.</text>
