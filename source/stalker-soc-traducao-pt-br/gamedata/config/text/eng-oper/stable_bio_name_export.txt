659|<text>Came to the Zone looking for adventure. Imitates the characters from popular comics of the 60s. Uses different names: Badman, Macho, the Black Coat, Banderos. Even though he has survived in the Zone for two whole years, no one really takes him seriously and it constantly drives him mad.</text>
662|<text>Fierce, wicked, crude, selfish, cruel, insensitive, cold. Nobody knows when and how he got to the Zone. Everyone fears him and he has no friends. He simply lives in the Zone, with no future and no past. After one of his numerous forays into the Zone, he lost his memory, forgotting nearly everything. He doesn’t remember where he comes from, doesn’t remember his real name, suffers from frequent lapses of memory. Known to completely forget his new acquaintance within an hour, take him for an enemy and kill him.</text>

680|<text>A cad, bootlicker, hypocrite and coward. Barin’s motto could well be, "After us, the Deluge". Takes advantage of any situation. Extremely ambitious and touchy. He came to the Zone, unsurprisingy, for money. For two years now he's been procuring material assets by all possible means. </text>
683|<text>Militant from the Duty faction. Usually well equipped. No details available.</text>
686|<text>Official recruiter for the Ukrainian Security Service. A frequent visitor of the bar. Everyone knows who he is, as well as the fact that he is the man to turn to when you fall on hard times. However, once you cross this line, there is no way back in the ranks of the honest stalkers.</text>
689|<text>In everyday life a phlegmatic who keeps his emotions to himself and always stays cool. However, when under stress, he gets peppery and aggressive. Highly intellectual. A materialist regretting he had come to the Zone in the first place. After graduating from the medical university, was sent into the Zone where the scientists’ camp needed a neurosurgeon assistant. Dissects mutant brains and researches their psychokinetic properties. Looking forward to his retirement when he can move back to the capital, as far as possible from this rotten place.</text>

734|<text>Experienced stalker. No details available.</text>
737|<text>Stalker born under a lucky star. Many times, the teams he was with would end up in tight spots and every time he was the only survivor. Most stalkers stay away from him on account of the bad luck he is said to bring. Has been roaming the Zone on his own for quite some time now. </text>
740|<text>One of the veterans. Knows the Zone like the back of his hand. Usually well equipped and highly dangerous. No details available.</text>
743|<text>Experienced smuggler. For a long time, plied his trade in Africa and South America. The news of the Chernobyl disaster brought him to Ukraine. In a short while, he managed to smuggle hundreds of stuffed mutants out of the restricted area and earned the nickname "Taxidermist". When not "working" in the Zone, he is a successful trader. Loves fancy suits and posh ties, but prefers Soviet guns.</text>
746|<text>Took part in the war in Afghanistan. Formerly an atheist, but after surviving a Mujahideen ambush, he emerged a religious man. After the war in Afghanistan, he emigrated to Poland where he enrolled into a theological seminary. Having graduated from the seminary, he preached at the Catholic church in Lvov. After the explosion at the Chernobyl NPP, he volunteered to help the victims. In the last few years has been preaching in the Zone</text>
749|<text>Formerly a mechanic at the "KholodMach" plant. After his wife left him, he decided to take his own life. However, being deeply religious, he chose the Zone as an unconventional suicide method. Contrary to his expectations, he survived. He has gained invaluable experience and has won the respect of other stalkers thanks to his professional skills. Master is probably the most qualified mechanic in the Zone, and repairs equipment and vehicles. Installing security systems in gang bunkers is what he does best. He is welcome everywhere he goes. A simple, stern man, a bit rough at times.</text>
752|<text>Former military stalker, lieutenant colonel in the Ministry of Interior troops. The only soldier to return from a disastrous operation deep in the Zone, later discovered that the mission was pointless and suicidal to begin with. That’s when he decided not to come back, staged his own death and joined the stalkers. Quiet, cynical, firm of purpose.</text>
755|<text>Rookie. New to the Zone. No details available.</text>
758|<text>Klutz is 20 years old. He lost everything and everyone in the Big Land before deciding to come here. He barely makes a living in the Zone, but he simply has no other place to go to. Owes money to many stalkers. Frequents the Zone, but never goes there alone. Always trying to hang on to a group of experienced stalkers. Not a popular companion, as more often than not, he's plain useless. Hardly makes any money. Lives on doles from other stalkers and is deep in debt.</text>
761|<text>Veteran stalker. Possibly well equipped. No details available.</text>
764|<text>Veteran stalker. Possibly well equipped. No details available.</text>
767|<text>Oleg "the Fiend" Gusarov. A former "Black Beret," served in the Belotserkovskaya Spetsnaz brigade. Served multiple tours, became a master sergeant. A sniper and a bomb technician. A loner at heart, never ventures into the Zone in a group, preferring to act alone. He was offered to join the clans numerous times, but always refused.</text>
770|<text>A student from the Department of Physics who dropped out his senior year. He left for the Zone in search of easy money. Likes to show off his "scientific" knowledge and discourse on abstract philosophical issues. It's reason enough for other stalkers not to like him. Overall, a pretty decent fellow. A kind of idealist.</text>
773|<text>Sparrow is 27 years old, cunning, and farseeing, but also capable of the worst blunders. Can be mean. A rather dubious persona. A scrawny and pallid type. Came to the Zone out of curiosity, promising himself he would return home after two months. He never did. On his very first sally into the Zone, Sparrow managed to cross a field strewn with anomalies barehanded and clueless to how dangerous that was. As soon as he found out what he had done, he passed out. Since then, celebrates that date (October 9) as his second birthday. </text>

788|<text>Leshiy, as his brother calls him, came to the Zone a young idealist. However, a few years of living a hairs breadth away from death, he turned him into a cynical realist. Considers the Zone his home, and thinks those who failed are unworthy to walk the face of the Earth.</text>
