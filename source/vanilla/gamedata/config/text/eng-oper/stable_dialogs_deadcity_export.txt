4|<text>I need answers to several questions.</text>
7|<text>Ask away, I'll try to help.</text>
10|<text>Where are my things?</text>
13|<text>The leader usually keeps all the confiscated stuff. His room is on the top floor. My things were taken there when they caught me.</text>
16|<text>Thanks!</text>
19|<text>How can I get out of here?</text>
22|<text>When they were leading me around I noticed a sewer grate under the stairs on the first floor... If you managed to open the cell it would be possible to get out of here using that sewer... It's best to go West and then you can use the tunnel to get to Freedom.</text>
25|<text>Thanks for the information.</text>
28|<text>Who captured us?</text>
31|<text>We're being held by the Mercs. Nobody really knows who they are but there are rumors that they work together with foreign intelligence services. The location of this base is top secret - no one knows how to get into the Dead City. Many people are very interested in this information, especially Freedom and Duty.</text>
34|<text>Go on.</text>
37|<text>If you manage to get a map of the Dead City, a successful assault will be possible. The Mercs or the bandits probably have one. You could try to get it.</text>
40|<text>Thanks for the information.</text>
43|<text>What do you know about this place?</text>
46|<text>The city is split into two sections. We're on the Merc side. To the South beyond the square is where the bandits are. They're holed up in the school building Southwest of the city. In between the bases, there is a run down five-floor building and a few relatively intact ones. If the shit hits the fan, you can sit it out there. There are also some garages and a couple of small houses around that area. There are a couple of five-floor buildings and a dozen garages on the bandits' side too. The former city council building is on the other side of the square.</text>
49|<text>Thanks for the information.</text>
52|<text>Who's in charge here?</text>
55|<text>A truly nasty guy named Dushman. I've seen him carrying around a folder with some documents a couple of times. I reckon there's something interesting inside.</text>
58|<text>Thanks for the information.</text>
61|<text>Nope, nothing.</text>
64|<text>Strelok! Where the hell have you been??? I haven't seen you or the guys since the last raid! I was getting worried!</text>
67|<text>So, you feeling better? You thinking clearly?</text>
70|<text>Strelok???</text>
73|<text>Yeah, you're Strelok! Who else would you be? I'm Doc, don't you recognize me? What happened to you, friend? You don't look well. We went into the Zone together for 2 years. You really don't remember me?</text>
76|<text>No, I don't.</text>
79|<text>You don't??? Strelok, what the...? You're not joking around, are you? Man... What about the guys, our guys? Presa, Ghost? You remember them, don't you?</text>
82|<text>I don't remember Presa, and Ghost is dead - I found his body in Yantar.</text>
85|<text>Ghost!!?!?! Dead??!!! Dammit, how could that happen?! They... they were the best. What happened to you?</text>
88|<text>I don't know what happened, I don't remember.</text>
91|<text>Wait, I need to calm down. That's some shitty news man. I think it's all linked with your last trip into the Zone. When we saw each other the last time, you left me the key from the stash at Pripyat and the map of how to find it. I've managed to keep it - hid it from the Mercs. Here, take it, hide it well. Perhaps you'll find somthing there. You were saying that there's some trick with the Monolith. But I don't understand what it was about, and you didn't either.</text>
94|<text>I see. Where are we? I don't remember how I got here.</text>
97|<text>We're in Dead City! In the Merc camp.</text>
100|<text>We're in Dead City!.. In the Merc camp...</text>
103|<text>By the way, I have information about the Mercs. Interested?</text>
106|<text>Depends on the information.</text>
109|<text>I have a map which details the location of their base, guard posts, the way to get in without being noticed and a lot more.</text>
112|<text>Sounds valuable. I'll give you 3000 for it.</text>
115|<text>Deal. Here.</text>
118|<text>Great! Here's your reward. Soon stalkers will argue about whether the Mercs even existed at all!</text>
121|<text>Not, that's not enough.</text>
124|<text>As you wish, I'm not giving you any more.</text>
127|<text>Nothing worthwhile. Just the usual gossip. Sorry.</text>
130|<text>If you find out something more specific come back. I'll pay you.</text>
