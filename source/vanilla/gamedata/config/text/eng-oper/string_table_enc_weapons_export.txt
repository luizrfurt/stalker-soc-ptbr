256|<text>Assault rifle with a folding butt, 1974 model, uses 5.45x39 mm ammunition. It is a simple and reliable weapon, but the cheapness of its production affected its ergonomy and accuracy.

259|<text>The modified closing system increases the speed of shooting.</text>
262|<text>The weight and size of the Akm 74/2U are similar to those of a submachine gun, but its operation mode and the ammunition it uses place it into the class of the assault rifles. Its advantages are its small dimensions very useful when fighting inside a building or in a thick forest and a relatively high piercing capabilities.

The accuracy and the killing power of this gun exceed those of all other small arms.\n Ammunition: 2-mm Gauss rounds.</text>
301|<text>An assault rifle combined with a grenade launcher. It is a very good type of assault rifle for the Zone conditions: it is compact, reliable, but universal and powerful.

310|<text>Hunting knife</text>
313|<text>After the British army replaced this rifle with the German-made GP 37, it appeared in large quantities first on the black market and then in the Zone.

In burst mode, its accuracy decreases greatly, and the main mechanisms of the rifle are not reliable enough.\n Ammunition:\n standard 5.56x45 mm SS109,\n armor-piercing 5.56x45 mm AP.</text>
316|<text>With a few modifications the effect of the throwing up of the barrell was diminished</text>

325|<text>Modification of storming weaponry for firing single shots. It was assumed that it was going to be used as a cheap analog to the sniper rifle.</text>
328|<text>One of the best weapons in the submachine gun class. During the last decades of the 20th century it was adopted by the army and police special forces units in many countries. When it was gradually replaced with more up-to-date models, it appeared on the black market, and then in the Zone.\n Ammunition:\n standard 9x19 mm FMJ,\n improved 9x19 mm PB1s.</text>
331|<text>Light, compact, and now redone to fit a more wide-spread caliber, this machine gun is a true find for beginning shooters.</text>

337|<text>A pistol with an integrated silencer, it was used by Soviet special forces. It is now outdated, but in skilful hands, still very effective.\n Ammunition:\n standard 9x18 mm,\n improved 9x18 mm +P+.</text>
340|<text>The most widespread pistol in the Zone. It is a legacy of the Soviet era. It is relatively reliable and cheap, has low magazine capacity, low power and an unsatisfactory grouping of shots. It is the main weapon of a beginning stalker.\n Ammunition:\n standard 9x18 mm,\n improved 9x18 mm +P+.</text>
343|<text>A revolver-type grenade launcher. Sometimes, it is just indispensable, particularly when targeting large numbers of mutants, attacking well-guarded stationary objects or fighting especially tough creatures.\n Ammunition: VOG-25 grenade,\n and VOG-25R grenade.</text>
346|<text>A variation of the revolving granade launcher. The given model is made especially for use of granades of the western model.</text>
349|<text>A grenade launcher developed in the 1960s. Such grenade launchers are stored in large quantities in army depots, from where they are transferred to the Zone. Such weapon is rare for stalkers: its huge dimensions and heavy weight make it unpopular, though it is indispensable for some missions.\n Ammunition: OG-7V.</text>
352|<text>The weapon was made for warfare in the city. To lessen the weight, some parts were removed or replaced. As a result, there is no way to attach neither a sight nor a granade launcher under the barrell. But at least it weighs almost half of what it did before.</text>
355|<text>Modified for sniper fire. Furnished with a non-removeable optical sight of heightened focus.</text>
358|<text>A model developed back in 1975 but still popular all around the world. Its magazine has low capacity, but its mechanism is absolutely reliable. Its second advantage is the use of the high-powered Kora round.\n Ammunition:\n standard .45 ACP,\n improved .45 ACP Hydro-Shock.</text>
361|<text>A relatively new assault rifle for the 5.56x45 mm SS109 round. This weapon is very popular due to its accuracy, soft recoil, and high reliability.\n Ammunition:\n standard 5.56x45 mm SS109,\n armor-piercing 5.56x45 mm AP.</text>
364|<text>The SPSA14 smooth-bore rifle was developed in the late 1970th. This weapon is very reliable and flexibly used. It is however relatively big, expensive and its mechanism is too complex. Probably, this is the best close range gun in the Zone.\n Ammunition:\n 12x70 shot,\n 12x76 slug,\n 12x76 dart.</text>
367|<text>UNIQUE WEAPON. This shotgun model has a rifled bore which greatly increases its accuracy when firing darts or slugs. However, using shot is more difficult.\n Ammunition:\n 12x70 shot,\n 12x76 slug,\n 12x76 dart.</text>
370|<text>This rifle was widely used in all operations of the Soviet and Russian armies since 1960. It proved itself to be an exceptionally reliable and handy weapon.

376|<text>A more up-to-date version of the sniper rifle. A compact bullpup model. It is excellent for long trips in the Zone.\n Ammunition:\n standard 7.62x54 mm 7N1,\n armor-piercing 7.62x54 mm BP,\n sniper 7.62x54 mm 7N14.</text>
379|<text>This hunting rifle is popular but thereâ€™s nothing noteworthy about it.\n Ammunition:\n 12x70 shot,\n 12x76 slug,\n 12x76 dart.</text>
382|<text>A reliable weapon. As a quality compact close-range weapon, it is very popular among the Zone veterans.\n Ammunition:\n standard .45 ACP,\n improved .45 ACP Hydro-Shock.</text>
385|<text>This weapon is based on the Vintar noiseless sniper rifle, but it has a folding butt, can fire bursts and has a larger magazine.

388|<text>Differs from the basic model in its ability to add an optical sight PSO-1.</text>
391|<text>A special sniper rifle designed for noiseless and flameless sniper fire and equipped with an integrated silencer. It can pierce any bulletproof vest at a range of 400 meters. It is a weapon highly valued by stalkers of any level.\n Ammunition:\n standard 9x39 mm PAB-9,\n armor-piercing 9x39 mm SP-6,\n sniper 9x39 mm SP-5.</text>
394|<text>An excellent pistol. Highly reliable with a high capacity magazine and a good fire accuracy, especially in the case of the model designed for the 9 mm FMJ round.\n Ammunition:\n standard 9x19 mm FMJ,\n improved 9x19 mm PB1s.</text>
397|<text>Modification of the gun for ability to use bullets of the 9x18mm calibre.</text>
