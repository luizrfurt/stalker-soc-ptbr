4|<text>I'm on a mission.</text>
7|<text>Hmm. What kind of mission? Are you looking for something? Or have you found it already? I've heard there's lots of goodies in here...</text>
10|<text>I'm sorry, I can't tell you and I don't have the time anyway.</text>
13|<text>Wait up, don't run yet. You'll have enough opportunities for that... What did you find? Myself, I'm not hanging around here for nothing, you know.</text>
16|<text>What I found is my business.</text>
19|<text>I found some documents from X18. The Barkeep promised to pay me well for them.</text>
22|<text>No, I haven't found anything.</text>
25|<text>I don't even know how I wound up here. I'd love to be off as soon as possible.</text>
28|<text>You haven't found anything worthwhile here, have you? They say there's some information about scientific experiments. They're worth some good money...</text>
31|<text>No, I haven't.</text>
34|<text>Yeah?.. And what if you think really well about it? Are you hiding something from me?</text>
37|<text>No.</text>
40|<text>What kind of question is that?</text>
43|<text>Are you threatening me?</text>
46|<text>To hell with all that information. I'm barely staying alive in here.</text>
49|<text>Alright then, off you go. If you find something - I'll be around...</text>
52|<text>Listen, pal, I've made it through fire, anomalies and monsters in this stinking Zone and as you can see I'm still alive! So don't you tell me what I can or cannot say. I've come here for the documents and I won't leave without them. If they're on you, I advise you to hand them over or rest in peace in this hole! Got it?</text>
55|<text>Got it.</text>
58|<text>If you're lying to me, you're in deep shit. If you've are thinking of screwing me, you're in deep shit, and if you try to shove me some crap, you're in deep shit. In fact, you're so deep in shit that you'll have to swim very hard to keep afloat! Now, let me try one more time for the idiots in the assistance: have you found the documents?</text>
61|<text>Alrighty, and next time, watch your mouth. You may go now. In case you find something, I'll be around...</text>
64|<text>This conversation is over. Get out of my way.</text>
67|<text>I don't have any documents.</text>
70|<text>That's much better, chum. Now give me all the information you've got, every little thing to the last scrap of paper. And don't even think of pulling anything funny 'cause that joke would be your last...</text>
73|<text>I'm telling you, stop! I'm not roaming around this rat hole for nothing. Stop horsing around and tell me what you've found. We could even split it...</text>
76|<text>I'm not sharing anything.</text>
79|<text>Uh-huh, sod off now... I got one last advice for you - watch your step, stalker, you'll need it!</text>
82|<text>Are you threatening me?</text>
85|<text>OK, OK, cool it... Soon as I get curious, you're grabbing your gun! No more questions. Just be careful, that's all.</text>
88|<text>Documents, huh... Just so you know, that's exactly what I came here for. And now you will hand them over and get on your way. Understood?</text>
91|<text>I'll offer something</text>
94|<text>Look, man, stop screwing with my brain. Let's make a deal. I'll give you a nice chunk of money - you won't be sorry.</text>
97|<text>Listen, my life depends on these documents. Let's see what you got - I think we can come to an agreement...</text>
100|<text>It's so dark here, I can't see a damn thing. Burers all around... Why did I ever agree to do this?! What about you, how did you wind up here?</text>
103|<text>Keep walking, stalker.</text>
106|<text>I hate it when someone interrupts when I speak. Anyway, I came here for some important documents. If you've found something, spill it out or you'll be in trouble. If you haven't found anything, get lost and stop wasting my time.</text>
109|<text>I hate it when someone interrupts when I speak. Gimme those documents if you don't want to part with your life.</text>
112|<text>I'll remember that.</text>
