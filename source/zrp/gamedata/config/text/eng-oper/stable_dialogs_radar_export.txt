4|<text>Hey!</text>
7|<text>Hey!</text>
10|<text>Where's the money for the mission?</text>
13|<text>Find my deputy and you'll get your money!</text>
16|<text>OK but don't lie to me this time!</text>
19|<text>Who are you?</text>
22|<text>Leha the Jaw is my name! These rogues are my crew!</text>
25|<text>What are you doing here?</text>
28|<text>My boys and I are resting! When we're done we'll head to Pripyat!</text>
31|<text>What do you know about Pripyat?</text>
34|<text>It's an old abandoned city from the communist era! From history! I reckon it's full of monsters and hordes of Monolith fighters now! No one who has gone there before ever returned!</text>
37|<text>You think it's dangerous?</text>
40|<text>No doubt about it - nobody has ever come back from there.</text>
43|<text>You seen any soldiers around?</text>
46|<text>No, I ain't seen any soldiers for a long time.</text>
49|<text>What about military stalkers?</text>
52|<text>Rumour has it that they showed up right by the Red Forest, by the antennae! When they were turned off many people went to the Red Forest and further into Pripyat! We've been here for a day and we haven't seen anyone. Someone probably blocked the road here.</text>
55|<text>You think the military blocked the road to the Red Forest?</text>
58|<text>I don't think it was the military, I haven't seen any for a long time but military stalkers could have done it! They don't waste any time. They're the no-nonsense types, they work quickly and efficiently in their teams or solo... it's weird that they didn't block the road here earlier.</text>
61|<text>Why did they not go to Pripyat or block the road there?</text>
64|<text>I don't know. Maybe they're afraid or they're getting ready for something. I can only guess.</text>
67|<text>Maybe you've got a mission for me?</text>
70|<text>Well, I have one but it's not easy...will you do it?</text>
73|<text>Saying it's not easy doesn't scare me!</text>
76|<text>Nah, no way. I don't have the time!</text>
79|<text>I understand. I'm afraid myself... would prefer to spend some money instead of sending my guys or going myself.</text>
82|<text>Good! The job is to find my scouts, Crowbar and Log! They went to Pripyat since I decided not to rush in and sent my best guys instead! Find them alive and bring them here. If they're dead bring me their weapons! Do this for me and you'll get 2000!!!</text>
85|<text>OK, deal!</text>
88|<text>Not enough. How about 4000 and we have a deal?</text>
91|<text>That's all I can offer you for this job!</text>
94|<text>OK, I'll wait for you here!</text>
97|<text>Mission accomplished!</text>
100|<text>Great, give me his PDA!</text>
103|<text>Here. Now the money!</text>
106|<text>You're trying to pull a fast one on me. He didn't have anything!</text>
109|<text>I'm gonna waste you right now!</text>
112|<text>If I see you again you're a dead man!</text>
115|<text>OK, I understand. Good luck!</text>
118|<text>I can't give you anything, I don't have any money. You can keep his stuff if you want.</text>
121|<text>I don't have any money! Go away!</text>
124|<text>I couldn't find him!</text>
127|<text>Find him fast if you want your money!</text>
130|<text>I found your boys. They died but here are their weapons!</text>
133|<text>Thanks, they're dead then. I don't think there's any point going to Pripyat now! There's a problem though - I don't have your money. My deputy disappeared and he had all the money!</text>
136|<text>OK, I'll find him! Tell me where to look for him. And don't even think about trying to cheat me out of my cash this time!!!</text>
139|<text>I don't think he got very far. He's probably here or here, I'll mark it on the map for you! When you find him, bring him or his PDA back here!</text>
142|<text>OK, wait for me!!!</text>
145|<text>I couldn't find them.</text>
148|<text>Find them fast! I can't wait forever!!! Good luck!</text>
