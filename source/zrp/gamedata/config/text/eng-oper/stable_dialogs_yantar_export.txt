4|<text>Thank you... err... Marked One, right? You helped save our associate Kruglov and in order to show my sincere appreciation I would like to present you with one of our working suits. It comes in very handy, you should know that... Could I be of additional help to you?</text>
7|<text>I'm looking for Lab X16. The Barkeep told me you might have info about its location.</text>
10|<text>We've long had an interest in Lab X16...or, rather, in the mechanism inside it that generates emissions which directly affects people's consciousness. I'm afraid I have to disappoint you: the place is impossible to penetrate without special psi-armor. The outcome is known in advance - even if you could evade the swarms of zombies that infest the laboratory entrance, you run the risk of becoming one of them. This is all very serious. However, we've designed a screening device to help shield the emission, but to fine-tune it we have to obtain additional measurements. If you help us with this task, we could probably provide you with a fully calibrated prototype for field testing.</text>
13|<text>Measurements?</text>
16|<text>If you, together with our associate, take all the necessary measurements, I will prepare a fully workable prototype of the armor and will give it to you. It will most likely let you get inside the laboratory.</text>
19|<text>OK, I agree.</text>
22|<text>Excellent! Talk to Kruglov and get going. He is already equipped with the necessary gear.</text>
25|<text>OK.</text>
28|<text>OK, I agree.</text>
31|<text>Excellent! Talk to Semenov and get going. He's got everything you will need.</text>
34|<text>OK.</text>
37|<text>No.. right now I don't want to sign up for this.</text>
40|<text>That's too bad, a real pity... I don't know how or when we could carry out this measurement expedition on our own.</text>
43|<text>Yes, Sir? What might you be looking for?</text>
46|<text>I'm looking for Lab X16. The Barkeep told me you might have info about its location.</text>
49|<text>Thank you, Marked One, for rescuing Kruglov. Take this pressurized suit as a reward for your troubles. Also, I suspect you didn't come here for a simple reward, am I right?</text>
52|<text>I'm looking for Lab X16. The Barkeep told me that you might have info about its location.</text>
55|<text>We have been studying the emission in Lab X16 for a long time, but you won't get in there without special equipment. We've developed a psi-protection device that can help shield you from the emission, but needs some fine-tuning. If you could help us with that, I could give you a working prototype that you can use to get inside the laboratory.</text>
58|<text>OK.</text>
61|<text>Excellent, talk to Kruglov and get going. He's got everything you'll need.</text>
64|<text>No, I'm not up for this yet.</text>
67|<text>That's a real pity. So far we've been unable to send a measurement expedition of our own.</text>
70|<text>Yes, Sir? What might you be looking for?</text>

91|<text>OK, I agree.</text>
94|<text>Excellent! Talk to Semenov and get going. He's got everything you will need.</text>
97|<text>OK.</text>
100|<text>You don't understand, there's an emitter. No one has been able to come closer than half a kilometer - it makes a zombie out of anyone. Going there without a suit is just like suicide, get it?</text>
103|<text>Hmm. That changes things.</text>
106|<text>To hell with it, just tell me all you know.</text>
109|<text>OK, but don't say I didn't warn you. Vasiliev worked on the laboratory problem. About a week ago, he and stalker by the name of Ghost attempted to get inside the laboratory. After several hours we felt a shake and emissions stopped; after another hour, we got a signal from Vasiliev, it was coming from the swamp but then vanished. By the looks of things, Vasiliev is gone. Try to find his body: he had accurate information about the laboratory - where it is and how to get in. He might have also known how to turn off the emissions. The laboratory entrance is most likely hidden in the basement of one of the buildings in the power plant area.</text>
112|<text>There we go, great.</text>
115|<text>No.. right now I don't want to sign up for this.</text>
118|<text>That's too bad, a real pity... I don't know how or when we could carry out this measurement expedition on our own.</text>
121|<text>Thank you... mmm... Marked One, right? You helped save our associate Kruglov and in order to show my sincere appreciation I would like to present you with one of our working suits. It comes in very handy, you should know that...</text>
124|<text>You did a splendid job, Marked One! Now that the emissions are turned off, we will be able to order new expeditions and explore previously inaccessible territories. And also... from now on we will conduct a most favorable pricing policy toward you.</text>
127|<text>Thank you.</text>
130|<text>Yes, Marked One? What are you looking for?</text>
133|<text>You did an excellent job. If the measurements are correct, the prototype should provide you with maximum protection from emission.</text>
136|<text>Glad to hear that.</text>
139|<text>Now your path to the laboratory is clear... except that if the source of the emission isn't destroyed and doesn't lose its power, you may not have enough time to get back. So, my dear Sir, here is the deal. Our calculations have produced an estimated location of the source as well as the fact that it is under ground. With your permission, I have already marked the spot on your map.</text>
142|<text>How exactly does one get inside Lab X16? Where is the entrance?</text>
145|<text>Vasiliev was working on the lab issue. About a week ago he and a stalker called Ghost tried to get inside. A couple of hours later we felt a major tremor, and after another hour we picked up a signal from Vasiliev coming from the swamp, but it died away. And Vasiliev died away with it, it would seem. Try to find his corpse. He had the exact information on the lab and the way to get into it. There may even be info on deactivating that source of the emission. I've uploaded you all the data we have.</text>
148|<text>Ahem...It would be very interesting to take a look at these documents. So, you think Vasiliev has them?</text>
151|<text>Perhaps. At any rate, you must start by finding Vasiliev's body - that is the only chance of obtaining accurate information about the lab's location. The body of your colleague, Ghost, must be somewhere there as well. You know, it seemed to me like he knew a lot more about X16 than he admitted to us. Had he somehow survived... Well, it's no use holding on to that hope, of course.</text>
154|<text>OK, I'll try.</text>
157|<text>Why did he die? You were supposed to protect him!</text>
160|<text>Kruglov got killed by the zombies... I couldn't help it, there were too many of them.</text>
163|<text>Oh, man...how could this happen? How could this happen??! Damn it, everything is going wrong again. Now we'll have to call for more people... We've got enough problems as it is... Damn...</text>
166|<text>Listen... Kruglov is gone, but I'm alive. Give me the prototype. I will fight my way inside X16.</text>
169|<text>Here is a prototype, be careful with it. It's not calibrated properly, but that's your fault - you failed to save our colleague. The device won't provide maximum protection, but at least it will lower the emission's intensity. So, stalker, you'll have to move fast on your way to the source.</text>

Well, it's no use holding on to that hope, of course.</text>
184|<text>OK, I'll try.</text>
187|<text>Why did he die? Weren't you supposed to protect him?!</text>
190|<text>Semenov got shot by the zombies... I couldn't help it, there were too many of them.</text>
193|<text>Oh, man...how could this happen? How could this happen??! Damn it, everything is going wrong again. Now we'll have to call for more people... We've got enough problems as it is... Damn...</text>

214|<text>OK, I'll try.</text>
217|<text>Yes, Marked One?</text>
220|<text>Yes, Marked One?</text>
223|<text>It's too bad that Kruglov died... Alas, nothing can bring him back. It's most important that you bring us the measurement data. Did you?</text>
226|<text>Yeah. Here.</text>
229|<text>Ok, let me adjust the prototype. Wait for me here.</text>
232|<text>Gotcha.</text>
235|<text>No.</text>
238|<text>Then get them, and quick! I cannot calibrate the prototype properly without them.</text>
241|<text>You did an excellent job. If the measurements are correct, the prototype should provide you with maximum protection from emission. </text>
244|<text>Can you be a little more clear?</text>
247|<text>Stalker, now you will be able to break through to the laboratory, but unless you turn off the emitter, you won't last long even with the psi-protection on. We've estimated an approximate location of the emitter; it is located in an underground facility. I have marked the spot on your map.</text>

262|<text>OK, I'll try.</text>
265|<text>There's no time...</text>
268|<text>Yes, Marked One?</text>
271|<text>The professor asked me to take a trip to the measurement site.</text>
274|<text>Now you're talking business! Let's move out immediately. It was no use getting there alone, but with you it's different... I think we'll manage quickly - just make sure not to let those cadavers get too close. So, you ready?</text>
277|<text>Yeah.</text>
280|<text>You know what... Why don't you go first. You've got a whole lot of experience, unlike me. And those cadavers are starting to move again...</text>
283|<text>OK.</text>
286|<text>Wow! Marked One here on a personal visit! Finally you've made it to our parts. Talk to the Professor - he wants to thank you for rescuing me.</text>
289|<text>Later, later!</text>
292|<text>Hey, Marked One! How are things going?</text>
295|<text>Yes, Marked One?</text>
298|<text>Professor asked me to take a trip to the measurement site.</text>
301|<text>Now you're talking business! Let's move out immediately. It was no use getting there alone, but with you it's different... I think we'll manage quickly - just make sure not to let those cadavers too close to you. So, you ready?</text>

310|<text>OK.</text>
313|<text>I'm sorry, I have no time for this right now.</text>
316|<text>Hey, Marked One! How's life?</text>
319|<text>Wait a little bit... We need to finish talking.</text>
322|<text>Wait! I'm not done taking measurements!</text>
325|<text>Yipe!. Ouch... argh..</text>
328|<text>You alive? C'mon, get up... Get up slowly. It's all over. It's behind us now.</text>
331|<text>Hey, Marked One. How are you?</text>
334|<text>Done! Pack the camera, time to get going!</text>
337|<text>Hey, Marked One! How's life?</text>
